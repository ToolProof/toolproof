    * Skydive Australia
* When visiting Perth, Australia, I tried skydiving for the first time. I won't talk about the experience, but a __side-experience__.
* While booking, I was skimming through Skydive Australia's terms and conditions and noted that they would weigh me before take-off. If weighed above 94 kg, or 207 pounds, there would be a surcharge.
* Just to make it clear--this did not apply to me.
* But, as an ethical individual, someone's problem is my problem, so I clicked the link to read more.
* While all skydiving companies have disclaimers in case you'll die, Skydive Australia also has one in case they insult you.
  * **Humour**
* They apologize for the feeling it might invoke having to pay extra because of your weight, then they explain the relationship between aviation and gravity, which answers __why they have to charge this extra fee__.
* Well, I disagree... You don't __have to__ charge this extra fee--you __choose__ to!
* I'll get back to that. Let me just explain why it upsets me.
* Being obese carries lots of disadvantages:
  * You joints and bones incur more strain, leading to a higher risk of developing arthritis and other musculoskeletal problems.
  * Moreover, obesity elevates your risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.
  * It can also contribute to decreased mobility and physical endurance, making daily activities more challenging.
  * Furthermore, higher body weight can affect your mental health, potentially leading to issues such as low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.
* With your "You weigh more, you pay more!" policy, you're letting those disadvantages compound by adding another one. In my opinion, that's not right.
  * **Humour**
  * **Renéthics**
* You're charging for extra kilos as if it was an add-on. For sufferers, it __is__ an add-on, but not one they should have to pay for!
  * **Humour**
* Everyone understands that weight matters in skydiving. With heavier customers you need bigger parachutes, you incur more strain on the harnesses, you burn more aircraft fuel, and you must refill the snack bowl in the waiting room more often.
  * **Humour**
* But how big of a problem is it?
* Less than fifteen percent of the adult population weigh more than 94 kilos.

* I dare the presumption that people in that group are less suceptible than the average person to seek skydiving experiences in the first place, so among your customres the actual percentage is probably lower. If you charged the rest of us a little extra--wouldn't that be sufficient to cover your extra costs without discriminating fat people?
* The idea is not new, nor is it mine. It's called __equalization__. My question is not why you need to cover your costs--that would be too easy. My question is why you don't chose to do it through equalization?
  * **Concept**: **Equalization**
* So, Skydive Australia--I prompt you to answer me.
* And, btw, thanks for a great experience--it was damn cool!
