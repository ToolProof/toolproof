* I've found out why it's so expensive to sleep here tonight.
* There's a big concert with a band called __The Eagles__.
* I had never heard about The Eagels.
* But somehow I knew they existed.
* I knew that bandname had to be taken.
* I just didn't knew the band who took it. Maybe there were several bands that took it. I didn't know the first band who took it who became big.
* I understand that they are big.
* I'm sure there are people who have traveled here to see them.
* From other places in The Netherlands.
* From other European countries.
* Maybe from other continents.
* Maybe someone who is here tonight are following the band, attending __all__ their concerts on this tour?
* It's facinating that there exists people who live on the same planet as me and devote their lives to something that I up until tonight didn't even know existed.
  * Share your experience with me under a **tag**!
* Am I stupid who didn't know The Eagles existed?
* Is it like not knowing about Messi and Ronaldo?
* Or is it like not knowing about Johan Kruyff?
* Maybe I'm too young?
* Based on the clientele here, I can tell they probably were at their peak in the seventies or eighties.
* I'm born in 87, so I don't buy the __too-young__ argument. People in mom's class probably listened to the Eagles. Do millenials know The Eagles? Except the\ouse who have parents, or maybe grandparents, who were hard-core fans.
* I'm not a mucic idiot in general. Just to give some context--although __I'm__ not a hard-core music enthusiast--yes, we exist--I have heard about most bands and artists that are so big that most people, at least in the western world, should.
* Metallica--I eaven know a couple of their names. James Hetfield, is that right? And that Dane--Lars Ulrich, who I often confuse with the German bycycle racer who were caught using performance-enhancing supplements.
* I also know The Beatles. I know the names of the core members. I know who's the oldest one of them because that's a quiz question in Trivial Pursuit--a game we play in Norway when we have to spend time with family--I don't know if you play it in other countries because I've had only one childhood and adolescence. I know how the members who are dead died. I know several of their songs, at least the refrains.
* I know other bands. I know Iron Maiden, and Creedence. I know Elvis--I even impersonated him once at a skoleavslutning--by the way the one the night Norwegian soccer died--calling myself Ren√©lvis. I know Justin Beaber and Taylor Swift. I've seen Queen with Adam Lambert and Hans Zimmer live. I know Pavarotti and Andrea Bochelli. I know that South-Korean dude who made Gangam Style, even if I can't pronounce his name. I've even been to Gangam in Seoul. I know Drake. I actually heard about him for the first time a couple of years ago.
* I read in a newspaper that people could now study him.
* Wow! People can study you...
* But I didn't know about The Eagles.
* Who are they?
* Maybe I've heard some of their songs?
* Maybe--in a version of the universe where I could sing--I could even perform the lyrics of one or some of their songs?
* The reason I'm bringing this up is this:
* I feel we are about to leave a world in which there's a homogeneous pool of celebrities who everyone knows about. Millenials will not be able to be as famous as The Eagles. And I'm gonna tell you why:
* Think about living in a world where the band name "The Eagles" was not taken... Think about it...
* It's the biggest bird that can fly... And no one had thought about naming their band after that bird.
* The basketball team here in Arnhem is called Arnhem Eagles.
* I've never been in a process of finding a band name, but I know the base process from trying to buy internet domains. Everything good is taken. Often it's not taken by people who has a product or service that perfectly fits the name, it's taken by someone who has made a bet that someone else will want to create such a product or service in the future, so that they can sell the domain to them and get rich.
* It's frustrating as hell! You know what I had to pay for vlogtalk.com?
* toolproof.com was a different story...
* If the ease of finding a bandname corresponds to the ease of releasing music and get noticed, I would say The Eagels were lucky. <!--If it didn't take more creativity back then to write their songs than it took to find an unused band name like The Eagles, I've got some bad news for the next generation.-->, 
* Millenials, you should know this: what you create might be a thousand times better, but it's not going to reach a thousandth of the fame. Because the world's cultural capacity is saturated. If you want to succeed, you must explore areas that are not saturated. It's harder, because they're not that visible.
* I wrote a book and published it on Amazon Kindle. I sold four physical copies. One was myself, the second was my cousin, who's a writer herself, the third was my friend who felt bad because he didn't take his assignment as a beta reader seriously, the fourth was some random person who I don't know.
* I'm happy if you buy it. All the money goes to a good case--it goes to me!
* I made an app game. Not in 2010, when any idiot could release a paid app and become a millionaire, but in 2020--when...  
* I dare the assertion that had The Eagles been formed today, they've never have obtained fame!
* Their lead singer is maybe the most famous person in the world who I haven't heard about?
* Now someone else is the most famous person in the world who I haven't heard about?
* If a spaceship full of aliens landed here and they were interrogating us humans before they took us hostages, and asked what we were here for, tell the truth--we can read it anyway and will punish you if you don't--most people would say they were here for a concert because on earth we have this phenomenon where...
* Some people would say they're here in some meta context (police, crew, volunteers).
* Only I would say I'm here because Vitesse is the name of the first version of my new app...
