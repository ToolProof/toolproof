* Do you know what this is? You don't! It's the Geldredome Wallet--it's a card that you need if you want to buy anything at the Geldredome Stadium here in Arnhem.

* The line behind me is the line to top-up your wallet with money, and after you've been in this line, you have to go another line to buy what you want to buy.

*  I this vlogtalk, I'll question custom coupon cards--something I can't believe that still exists in 2024.
* I'm sure there's research corrobborating such system's are net-efficient. But is there any __new__ research, applicable to today, when everyone has a card and most people use some type of mobile payment?
* The Geldredome is one of the most advanced arenas in the world...
* Do you keep this system to gain on people's unused credits?
* "But you stand in the top-up line only once," I hear you saying. Wrong! You don't wanna top-up with too much, so you end up topping up too little and returning to the line several times.
* How much to top-up with is actually a hard decision. For that reason, the top-up line is slow. Even if you've made a decicion while queuing, if you're a new customer, you get new information at the counter, regarding the five-increment rule, so you have to make a new decision.
* My basic reasoning behind the assertion that this is an inefficient system is that customers have to stand in two lines instead of one--and two is more than one.
* For that to be efficient, the sum of the time it takes to stand in those two lines must be less than the time it takes to stand in one line. I just can't see how that can be the case.
* The second inefficiency is in terms of exploitation. Or is exploitation what this is about?
* The third inefficiency is that it creates complexity for the customer, who has to keep track of an extra magnetic card--that should not be kept too close to other cards.
* The fourth inefficiency is in terms of the environmental impact of using plastic cards.
