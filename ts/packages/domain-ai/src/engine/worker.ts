/**
 * Represents a Worker within ToolProof.
 * 
 * A Worker is an entity that operates toward a specified subgoal, defined by a direction object. This object includes:
 *  - A subgoal to pursue
 *  - A description of the direction
 *  - A suggested set of tools (though Workers may also utilize additional tools)
 * 
 * Workers generate an array of actionables—tasks that can be executed by Humans, and potentially in the future by Tools or other Workers, to achieve the specified subgoal.
 * 
 * Behavior:
 *  - If no direction is provided, a Worker defaults to pursuing the prime goal.
 * To be implemented:
 *  - When multiple Workers are created with the same or similar subgoals (including the prime goal), ToolProof consolidates them into a single Worker to maximize efficiency.
