 * Represents a Worker within ToolProof.
 * 
 * A Worker is an entity that operates toward a specified subgoal, defined by a direction object. This object includes:
 *  - A subGoal to pursue (currently, only "curing a disease" is supported)
 *  - A description of the direction
 *  - A suggested set of tools (though Workers may also utilize additional tools)
 * 
 * NB: If no direction is provided, a Worker defaults to pursuing the prime goal.
 * 
 * To be implemented:
 * Workers generate an array of actionablesâ€”tasks that can be executed by Humans, and potentially in the future by Tools or other Workers, to achieve the specified subgoal.
