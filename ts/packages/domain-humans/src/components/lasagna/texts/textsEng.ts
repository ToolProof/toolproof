    Tools: 'Tools involve specialized tools that support the drug discovery process through molecular docking, molecular dynamics, quantum mechanical free energy calculations, and more. These tools, often Python-based (e.g., AutoDock Vina, Schrödinger Suite), stress-test the Candidate’s ability to bind to target molecules, usually proteins.',
